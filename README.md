# WavePortal dApp ðŸ‘‹

This project demonstrates a basic smart contract. It allows users to send
messages to a smart contract, and display it as some kind of a log. 

## __buildspace

This project is the result from following [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/)'s
hands on [course](https://buildspace.so/solidity) "Build a Web3 App on Ethereum
with Solidty + Smart Contracts". It's a free, high quality course and I
personally recommend everyone that wants to start learning how to develop dApps
to go and try out!

## Directory Structure

```
.
|-- contracts
|  |-- WavePortal.sol
|-- scripts
|  |-- run.js
|__ test
```

The `run.js` script will compile and deploy the smart contract using `Hardhat`.
